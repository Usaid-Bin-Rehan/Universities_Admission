Some questions asked from seniors: 

1. U went Germany only for MS or to get good profile so u can go US/Canada/UK for permanent residence? Or will come back here ?
2. Possible to have or good to think about PR in Europe/ US after studying from Germany?

Answers: 

1. My first priority was US, but I am thinking Germany as a gateway to get a stable entrance in US. 
First my plan is to get PR in Germany and then move forward to plan on going for US.

2. I'm here to do my master's degree and then work, and if it all goes well I'm staying here long term.

3. German is a good country. I will try to get the citizenship. Other than that, Europe has a good work
culture and is really positive outlook toward life. It all depends on your preferences.. USA has good pay.
