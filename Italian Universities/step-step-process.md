There are four types of scholarships:
1. Italian scholarship called MAECI scholarship.

The first three require high grades and have high competition, but we will focus on regional scholarships.

**When to Apply for Regional Scholarships:**

Regional scholarships open from **June to September**. 
You must be active during this time because different **regional scholarships announce their calls during this period**. So, you can't apply before June.

For regional scholarships, there's no need for high grades, and most students can easily obtain them. 
These are **need-based scholarships** provided by the **Italian government**, not the university.

*Requirements for Regional Scholarships:*
1. Get admission to any public uni versity.
2. Have a low income, less than **25k euros yearly - 75 lacs**.
3. Provide a family income certificate.
4. Property certificate.

**The Application Process:**

1. When scholarship applications open from June to September, read the scholarship call. Let's take DSU scholarship as an example.
2. When admissions open for DSU, read the call, which consists of 40 to 50 pages explaining everything and their requirements.
3. Once the call is released, proceed with the application process. Fill in your personal and financial details, including the family income certificate, property certificate, and bank balance certificate, but only when the scholarship application period is open.
4. Submit your application, and you've applied for the scholarship.

**Ranking and Visa:**

- Provisional ranking will be published between September and October.
- The final ranking will be published on the 31st of October. You can find all these details in the scholarship call.

After getting your visa, you'll need to physically submit these documents at the CAF office in Italy, but they won't be accepted without attestation.


These documents should be translated into Italian. Make sure to use an authorized translator. After attestation, the CAF will accept your documents, and you will be awarded the scholarship in Italy. Once eligible, you can open a bank account and provide the account number on the scholarship website to receive stipends in three installments, with 50% of the scholarship paid in December.
